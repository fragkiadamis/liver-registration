Preprocessing shit that I might want to try before the volume registrations...
1) Check the results with the bounding boxes with the original intensities. Check for preprocessing if any
   kind of normalisation is going to better the results. Maybe set every pixel that is less than zero on the CT
   to 0 (or -1000... check if this yields different results in the registration process).

2) Later check also about histogram preprocessing for the images.

3) Try translating the boundary boxes using only the corners (Felix' idea). Maybe I'll need to code myself the
registration process here... Check if I can do it with the feature points registration in elastix manual (Section 6 -
Advanced Registration)

4) Try extracting the boxes with only the contours or the outlines as 1 (my idea). Then try a number of the experiments
described above to make a comparison and find out if this method actually helps the registration of the bounding box.
