  "description": "The initial dice index is calculated between the masks of the fixed and the moving image.\nThe bounding box of the mask of the moving image is registered on the bounding box of the fixed image.\nWith this we can increase the overlap of the two images.\nThe transformation is applied on the mask and the dice index is recalculated as a reference.\nThe transformation is then applied on the images, and from there the images are registered with the regular rigid and bspline pipeline but with a higher initial overlap.\nAfter the registration, the new transformation is applied on the masks and the dice index is recalculated.",
